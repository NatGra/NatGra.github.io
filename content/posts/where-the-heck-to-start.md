# How to set up a blog

## Where the heck do I start?
To set up a blog, there are sooooo many uncountable ways. You can use an existing platform, like [dev.to](https://dev.to/) or [medium](https://medium.com/), creating a "new" blog from scratch with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/support/five-step-blog-setup/), or use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).


## My setup
As I already had an account for GitHub, and feel quite comfortable with it, I decided for as setup with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). So, I began with creating an empty repository with my username, "natgra.github.io", and then followed [this tutorial](https://pages.github.com/). Technically, I could have just simly added an `index.html`-file in there with some more content - done.
But as I mentioned in the previous post, I am curious and wanted to try something different. While "coding" along the tutorial, I stubbled across [Blogging with Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), and gave it a look. A "a static site generator" written in Ruby - uuh, interesting - however, I have tried Ruby a few times and did not get warm with it. So I looked a bit more around and found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
