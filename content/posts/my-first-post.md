# My first post - or, the advanture of setting up a blog

## To have a blog, or not to have one
I thought about it quite some time: starting a blog.  It seems like an adventure. You need to figure out a few things in advance, like _what do you want to talk about?_, _where do I host the blog?_, and _where the heck do I start?_. It seemed to be a lot of work, so here is my journey and why I started:

First, I want to improve on a technical level. Writing about tech-related topics makes you actually **think** about them, and trying to explain a complex issue to someone makes you rethink the issue. Probably even from a different angle. 

Secondly, a blog - or a convincing web presence in general - seems to be a desirable outcome in the tech scene. There is almost no one who does not have their own website. Of course, this is not mandatory to have a web presence, but it seems to be useful for certain.

Thirdly and finally, my curiousity has always outweight my dedication to specialize. And setting up a new project is just another advanture into unknown waters.  
During my journey as Software Engineer and even before, I have seen a bunch of technologies, different frameworks, and have touched several programming languages. If you would have asked me a few years ago where the journey of studying Computer Science is going, I probably would have answered that I would like to do human-machine communication professionally. Now, I am "stuck" writing backend services. Lately, I have discovered DevOps, and got interested in that.  
So you see, I am still discovering new areas.

On the other side, maintaining a blog seems like a lot of work and dedication. Finding topics to write about, preparing articles to be published, maintaining the pages, and probably way more things to be done.  
But I feel willing to take the challenge. The benefits are convincing. So here I am now, trying to set up my first website, including the first post. I think I will be writing about the questions from the beginning, _where do I host the blog?_ and _where the heck do I start?_, in another article, they look like a good starting point. Here we go ...
